# Alkaid

Trying to implement some reinforcement learning algorithms with easy to read code, high speed and well performance.

The supported algorithms currently include:

- DQN (Deep Q-Networks)
    - [DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)
    - [Double DQN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf)
    - [Dueling DQN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf)
